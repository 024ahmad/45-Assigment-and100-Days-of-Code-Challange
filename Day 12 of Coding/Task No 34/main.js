// Task No 34 : Pizzas 
// Think of at least three kinds of your favorite pizza. Store these
// pizza names in a array, and then use a for loop to print the name of each pizza.
// • Modify your for loop to print a sentence using the name of the pizza
// instead of printing just the name of the pizza. For each pizza you should
// have one line of output containing a simple statement like I like pepperoni
// pizza.
// • Add a line at the end of your program, outside the for loop, that states
// how much you like pizza. The output should consist of three or more lines
// about the kinds of pizza you like and then an additional sentence, such as
// I really love pizza!
// Solution:
let pizzas = ["Fajita Pizza", "BBQ Pizza", "Chicken Tikka Pizza"];
// 1st Method
// for (let pizza of pizzas) {
//     console.log (`I like ${pizza}`)
// }
// console.log ("I Really Love Pizza! ")
// 2nd Method
// pizzas.forEach ((pizza) => {
//     console.log (`I like ${pizza}`)
// })
// console.log ("I Really Love Pizza! ")
